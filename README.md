# Advanced Tic Tac Toe Game



## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an advanced version of the Tic Tac Toe game, featuring user authentication, personalized game history, and an intelligent AI opponent. The game supports both player-vs-player and player-vs-AI modes, enabling users to log in, track their game history, and analyze past games. The project adheres to best practices in software engineering, including secure user management, rigorous testing, and professional version control workflows.
